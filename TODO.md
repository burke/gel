# gel gem / gel bundle

Maybe split some commands into gel gem / gel bundle namespaces with top-level
aliases... `gel install` and `gel install-gem` really points to this problem.

`gel up` implying `gel install`, freeing up `gel install` for `gel install-gem`
would be nice (at least for Shopify mindset) but plausibly too foreign for
others.
